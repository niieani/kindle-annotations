# Summary #
The Amazon Kindle 3 devices have got the capability to add annotations to PDF files, but stores them in a separate binary file, making it unusable for a normal PDF reader. This project aims to write the annotations back into the PDF, to allow a normal PDF reader to show the annotations you made.

If you are very happy I implemented the Kindle Annotator you can support my work in two ways: Firstly you can tell everyone you like the tool  or secondly you can donate some money so I can buy more E-Book reader devices.

# Fast Track #
Download the current release, unzip it and call `java -jar kindle-annotator.jar -in <kindle.pdf> -out <result.pdf>`. If you have more questions, visit [the usage information](Usage.md).

# Challenge #
The annotations are stored in a binary-formatted file and there is no available documentation that explains the format. The format has to be reverse engineered  ([results](PDRFileFormat.md)).
